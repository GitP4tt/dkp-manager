## Item Auctions

When items are looted after bossfights the lootmaster can create the item auctions in the DKP Manager App. Players can bid on items in realtime with their DKP. The lootmaster ends the auction and announces a winner. The DKP amount of the bid will be withdrawn from the winner's DKP balance.
